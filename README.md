# Google Play Music Controller
## A Chrome Extension

I use *Google Play Music* all the time, in a pinned tab in Chrome. I wanted a controller for it that could work from any tab, so I decided to build this. Feel free to use if you want, but right now it's just a small hobby-project.

(Yes, I know there are already extensions for this. I didn't even bother looking. **I wanted to build something.**)
